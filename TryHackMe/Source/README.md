This machine has a pretty recent vulnerability which we will exploit.

## Scanning

When scanning, we can see that there are 2 ports open. This machine has `ssh` and `Webmin` running. 

```
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

## Webmin

By looking into the "Webmin" page a bit more, we know it is version `1.890`. Knowing this we can search the internet for existing exploits of this version. In this case we are lucky and there is actually an exploit for this version `CVE-2019-15107`. In metasploit there is a module `exploit/linux/http/webmin_backdoor` which we will use. Once ran, we get a shell as the user `root` which means we can do anything and extract all the information we need.
